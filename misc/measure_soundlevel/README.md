# Measuring Sound Pressure Level (SPL)

This script can be used to record an audio sample via a microphone and analyze the sound pressure level (in dB SPL) of that sample. This is useful when tuning speakers to a specific loudness.

In order to run the script, an external library needs to be downloaded and placed in this folder: [SPL lib](https://ch.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/35876-sound-pressure-level-calculator)
